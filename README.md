# fullstack-react
It's a fork of [fullstack-react](https://github.com/Widen/fullstack-react).
Api tests inited here based on visionmedia [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).

A simple, full-stack JavaScript single page app featuring [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), 
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), and [Falcor](http://netflix.github.io/falcor/). This is a fork of
[spring-react-demo](https://github.com/Widen/spring-react-demo) with a new backend (node) and a new API (via Falcor). All of this is explained in detail in [a Widen Engineering blog post](http://engineering.widen.com/blog/future-of-the-web-react-falcor/).

The app constructed here is simple - a list of names, maintained on the server, with the ability to display, add, and maniplate names in the list via the browser.

## Starting the app  

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run webpack`
3. `node start`
4. Navigate to http://localhost:9090
